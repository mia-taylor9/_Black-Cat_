After looking through the the webiste I found one that spoke to me. The one I like is https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1179185 Interactive noise by reona396
I really liked the movement of the piece. The colors follow the movement but some also go in different directions creating an abtract piece. I also like the color palette.
I would like to learn how this piece was created.
